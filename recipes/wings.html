    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These baked Buffalo wings are super crispy without being fried. You can toss them in more hot sauce if you like them spicier! They take only 10 minutes to prep, but it's best if the wings are refrigerated for about an hour before baking so the coating is firm.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>20 chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and lightly grease with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place flour, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt into a resealable plastic bag, and shake to mix. Add chicken wings, seal the bag, and toss until well coated with the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Transfer wings to the prepared baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oven is preheating, whisk together melted butter and hot sauce in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Dip wings into butter mixture, and place back on the baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip wings and continue to cook until crispy on the outside and no longer pink in the center, about 25 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
